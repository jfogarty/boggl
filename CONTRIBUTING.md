## Contributing

Contributions the Boggl toolset will be very welcome when an alpha version is
available. Please feel free to examine and comment at this stage.

You can contribute in different ways: spread the word, report bugs, come up with
ideas and suggestions, and contribute to the code.

There are a few preferences regarding code contributions:

- Violate code style when there is a good reason, not because you feel like it.
- Send pull requests to the `develop` branch, not the `master` branch.
- Only commit changes to source files under `src` and `test`, not to builds
  located in `dist`.

Thanks!  JF

#** NOT READY FOR PRIME TIME **

When the branches are ready for actual developers, I'll remove this message.
For the next few months this project is closed to external developers.
Please stand by.
